A full responsive wordpress site. 
This is my final degree project where I created a fully responsive one-page wordpress website. 
I've created a new wordpress theme from scratch, wich contains a start-page, menu-page and an event-page.
I've used sass for this project and gulp for compiling css and javascript. 

The project also contains semantic code with html5 markup and the most parts of the site is UX and accessibility friendly.
The site contains responsive images and svgs for icons and looks nice on tablet and mobile devices. The site has full support
for all the modern browsers including IE 10 & 11. Design and images taken has been created by me.
